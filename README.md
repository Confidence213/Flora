# FloraFauna - species tracking community

FloraFauna is a web-based application used to keep track of local flora and fauna species within a given geographic area. Users are able to upload pictures and descriptions of species they have come across throughout their travels and upload them to the application, allowing other users to keep track of local wildlife populations within their location. FloraFauna mainly features an interactive map with community-uploaded pinpoints of wildlife sightings where other users can comment and like the pictures while working together to identify the flora/fauna associated with the pinpoint.
